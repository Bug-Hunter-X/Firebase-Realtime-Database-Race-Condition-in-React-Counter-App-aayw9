To resolve the race condition, we can utilize Firebase's transaction functionality:

```javascript
//Improved counter component using transactions for atomicity
function Counter() {
  // ... (useState and useEffect remain the same)

  const incrementCounter = async () => {
    await runTransaction(ref(db, 'counter'), (currentData) => {
      const newCount = (currentData ? currentData.count : 0) + 1;
      return { count: newCount };
    });
    // Update the local state after the transaction is successful
    const snapshot = await get(ref(db, 'counter'));
    const data = snapshot.val();
    setCount(data.count);
  };
  // ... (rest of the component remains the same)
}
```
Using transactions ensures that the increment operation is atomic, preventing race conditions and guaranteeing data consistency.
